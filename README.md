# Dpr
Dpr is a totally reverse engineering recreation of the Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shinning Pearl Unity Project.

Originally planned to be a decomp, it became quickly aware that and kind of 1 to 1 decomp would be impossible thanks to the masive changes that happened between originally writing the code, converted into Intermediate Language, converted to C++, compiled into an nso, disassembled by us, and rewritten as C#. So unlike other Pokemon decomp projects we are focused more on matching functionality than matching code.
 
Please only use 2019.4.31f1 when opening the project. It is the updated LTS build of the version BDSP is built on and will keep issues to a minimum.
